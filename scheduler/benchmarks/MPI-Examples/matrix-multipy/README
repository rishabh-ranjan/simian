I. Compiling
------------
For GNU/Linux based systems, run:
`make linux`
The resulting binary will be called `mm`

For Solaris (Unix) systems, run:
`make solaris`
The resulting binary will be called `mm_solaris`

II. Usage
---------
For Linux based systems, run:
`./mm`
You will see this output:
Usage: mm -n <size> <option>
            Flag    Timing Function
    	    -t      time()
            -g      clock_gettime()
            -u      getrusage()
            -r      gethrtime()

The argument size is required, and is the array size.  The option argument is 
also required and specifies the timing choice.  Not that -r is ONLY available
on Solaris, and will not show up as an option on GNU/Linux systems.

A example execution:
`./mm -n 128 -t`

III. Theory of Operation
------------------------
Two nXn matrices are created and filled with random integers.
The resulting value in the rth row and cth column is calculated as:

c(r,c) = sum[a(r,0)*b(0,c)+a(r,1)*b(1,c)+...+a(r,n)*b(n,c)]
